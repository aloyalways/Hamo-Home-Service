# Hamo - Home Service

Hamo is an Application for Home Service, House Work App, Handyman App, & more with many more features. The design for this Application was inspired by [this](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1111338473512770566). This application have both light and Dark mode which was the motivation to create this project.

## Motivation
The motivation for this project came when I thought of learning light and dark mode in Flutter. This project will help the early flutter developers to understand how to follow proper Flutter/Dart guidelines and Architecture. This project also uses Provider for the state management.
